Conducted a multi-period financial resilience study using macroeconomic data (FRED) and industry financial ratios to evaluate performance during recessions, recoveries, and inflationary shocks. Developed an Economic Health Index by normalizing GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and financial stress to contextualize FP&A decision-making under uncertainty. Compared liquidity, leverage, and profitability metrics across Real Estate, Software, and Crop Production to explain why asset-light industries outperformed during crises. Delivered insights through clear visual storytelling (heatmaps, trend charts, ratio dashboards) aligned with real-world FP&A and risk management workflows.
